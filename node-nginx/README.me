-- http is plain text
-- https encrypts the traffic
-- digital certificate is something you get when you want to support https
--- it includes encrypts with 1 key, and decrypts only with one key
--- public key/private key
--- sends it to a certificate authority; verifies that you own the domain name
--- browser has root certificates already but... 
--- anybody who hits your server can get your public key
--- symmetric is faster than asymmetric
